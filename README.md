<bold>Our Mission<bold> <br>
Our mission is to be that social media; the good one. The one that accepts and rejoices NSFW content, values privacy, and listens to its users.

We praise creators; we want to encourage them to monetize their work and help them communicate with their fan base. 

We strive to be non-corporate. Unlike Twitter or Facebook and Instagram, we are fully transparent in our policies. We are pro-privacy, and to show our commitment, we will be open source and free to use from the start.
